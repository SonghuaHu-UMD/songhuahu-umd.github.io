Nowadays, advanced wireless communication, unobtrusive positioning technologies, ubiquitous camera surveillance system, 
and large-scale big data infrastructures have generated extensive volumes of transportation data,
revolutionizing the approach to monitoring, quantifying, and modeling human travel. 
My work has encompassed a wide range of prevalent data sources within the transportation field in recent years.
My ultimate objective is to fuse these emerging data sources to enhance urban transportation systems, 
rendering them more perceptible, intelligent, and efficient.

### Mobile Phone Location
The 21st century witnessed the wide spread of mobile phones with positioning sensors.
Data from positioning sensors inside mobile phones contain massive spatiotemporal information on individual travel. 
Compared with traditional surveys and static sensors, mobile phone location data have 
population-representative penetration rate, wide spatiotemporal coverage, and near-real-time update frequency. 
My research have demonstrated its strong capability in travel demand modelling, infectious disease control, 
accessibility analysis, and social equity:

> Using location data of over 150 million monthly active mobile devices in the US, 
we successfully measures how human mobility change during the COVID-19 pandemic using three metrics: 
average number of trips per person; average person-miles traveled; and percentage of residents staying home. The mobility informatics are analyzed daily 
and made available to the public via an [online platform](https://data.covid.umd.edu/).

### Traffic Camera Footage
Traffic cameras have been installed by local DOT over the world to help monitor traffic flow and capture traffic violation.
These cameras contain rich visual information on vehicle, pedestrian, and road infrastructure. My research have demonstrated 
its strong capability in traffic flow monitoring, traffic emission estimation, and environmental justice:

> By scraping traffic footage from over 800 cameras in New York City, we reconstruct a citywide
bottom-up emission model to quantify pedestrian exposure to traffic emission considering potential environmental justice.
Via cutting-edge object detection, tracking, and segmentation method, we extract detailed traffic flow information (speed, volume, density, etc.), 
pedestrian volume, and over 3000 vehicle modes and types from camera footage. These details are validated via free floating cars and roadside sensors
