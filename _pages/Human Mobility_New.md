Nowadays, advanced wireless communication, unobtrusive positioning technologies, ubiquitous camera surveillance system, 
and large-scale big data infrastructures have generated extensive volumes of transportation data,
revolutionizing the approach to monitoring, quantifying, and modeling human travel. 
My research aims to fuse these emerging data sources to make urban transportation systems more senseable, intelligent, and efficient.

### <span style="color: blue"> Mobile Phone Location </span>
The 21st century witnessed the wide spread of mobile phones with positioning sensors.
Mobile phone location data contain massive spatiotemporal information on individual travel. 
Compared with traditional surveys and static sensors, mobile phone data have 
high penetration rate, wide spatiotemporal coverage, and real-time update frequency. 
My research demonstrates its strong capability in modelling travel demand, disease transmission, 
accessibility, and social equity:

> Using location data of over 150 million monthly active mobile devices in the US, 
we successfully measures how human mobility change during the COVID-19 pandemic using three metrics: 
average trips per person, average person-miles traveled, and percentage of residents staying home. Date are updated daily 
and made publicly available via an [online platform](https://data.covid.umd.edu/).

### <span style="color: blue"> Traffic Camera Footage </span>
Traffic cameras play a crucial role in traffic flow monitoring and traffic violation capture. 
These cameras contain continuous ground-truth visual information on vehicles, pedestrians, and road infrastructure. 
My research leverages them for traffic flow monitoring, traffic emission estimation, and environmental justice analysisï¼š

> By scraping camera footage from over 800 traffic cameras in New York, we reconstruct a citywide emission model to 
quantify pedestrian exposure to traffic emission considering environmental justice.
Via cutting-edge object detection, tracking, and segmentation method, we extract detailed traffic flow, 
pedestrian volume, and > 3000 vehicle modes from camera footage, providing more accurate and detailed inputs for both micro and macro traffic emission models.

> Current studies mainly focus on high-FPS traffic video installed on freeway. 
However, most traffic cameras installed in the urban area only provide low-FPS footage. 
We propose a unified framework that can extract traffic flow information from traffic videos with different quality, 
covering super-low FPS (< 1/5), low FPS (1/5 - 1), and high FPS (>1) videos, by involving the fundamental diagram, 
the distance-based tracking, and the ByteTrack, respectively. 
We also design a fully automatic traffic flow detector generator by using vanishing points detection and road segmentation.

### <span style="color: blue"> Social Media Text </span>
Social media comments provide a rich source of text data containing population attitudes, sentiments and perceptions.
My research centers on extracting human sentiments regarding topics related to urban planning and travel, 
such as parking challenges in dense city center and fast-growing food delivery services. 
I also fuse them with mobile phone location data to track how individuals respond to natural disasters.

> The surge in food delivery services is reshaping lifestyles and urban form.
Through an analysis of customer reviews of food delivery services extracted from nationwide Google Reviews, 
we aim to examine how people's attitudes to food delivery change before and after the pandemic, 
and to identify the key related factors. By fusing with mobile phone location data,
we further examine whether the growth of delivery services would decrease in-person visit to restaurant.
