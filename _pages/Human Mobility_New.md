Nowadays, advanced wireless communication, unobtrusive positioning technologies, ubiquitous camera surveillance system, 
and large-scale big data infrastructures have generated extensive volumes of transportation data,
revolutionizing the approach to monitoring, quantifying, and modeling human travel. 
My research aims to fuse these emerging data sources to make urban transportation systems more senseable, intelligent, and efficient.

### Mobile Phone Location
The 21st century witnessed the wide spread of mobile phones with positioning sensors.
Mobile phone location data contain massive spatiotemporal information on individual travel. 
Compared with traditional surveys and static sensors, mobile phone location data have 
high penetration rate, wide spatiotemporal coverage, and near-real-time update frequency. 
My research demonstrates its strong capability in travel demand modelling, infectious disease control, 
accessibility analysis, and social equity assessment:

> Using location data of over 150 million monthly active mobile devices in the US, 
we successfully measures how human mobility change during the COVID-19 pandemic using three metrics: 
average trips per person, average person-miles traveled, and percentage of residents staying home. Date are updated daily 
and made publicly available via an [online platform](https://data.covid.umd.edu/).

### Traffic Camera Footage
Traffic cameras, deployed by local government worldwide, play a crucial role in traffic flow monitoring and traffic violation capture. 
These cameras contain continuous ground-truth visual information on vehicles, pedestrians, and road infrastructure. 
My research leverages them for tasks such as traffic flow monitoring, traffic emission estimation, and environmental justice analysis：

> By scraping traffic footage from over 800 cameras in New York, we reconstruct a citywide
bottom-up emission model to quantify pedestrian exposure to traffic emission considering potential environmental justice.
Via cutting-edge object detection, tracking, and segmentation method, we extract detailed traffic flow, 
pedestrian volume, and over 3000 vehicle modes from camera footage. 
Extracted information provide more accurate and detailed inputs for both micro and macro traffic emission models.

### Social Media Text
Social media posts and comments provide a rich source of text data containing population attitudes, sentiments and perceptions.
My research centers on extracting these attitudes and sentiments from Google Reviews related to urban planning and human travel, 
such as parking issues in dense city center and fast-growing delivery services in restaurants. 
I also fuse them with mobile phone location data to monitor how individuals respond to various natural disasters：

> The surge in food delivery services is reshaping lifestyles, travel patterns, and urban form.
People may visit restaurants less frequently, and more restaurants may escape from city center to suburban 
with lower rental costs, evolving into "dark kitchens".
Through an analysis of customer reviews of food delivery services extracted from a nationwide Google review dataset since 2019, 
we aim to examine how people's attitudes to food delivery services have changed before and after the pandemic, 
and to identify the primary factors influencing customer sentiments in this context.
