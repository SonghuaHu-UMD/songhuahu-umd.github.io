Mobile devices (cellphones, connected vehicles) with positioning sensors are ubiquitous.
These devices generate vast amounts of spatiotemporal data on individual travel.
Compared to traditional surveys and static sensors, mobile device location data offer higher penetration rates, broader spatiotemporal coverage, and real-time updates.
My research show their powerful capability in modeling travel demand.

Traffic cameras play a crucial role in traffic flow monitoring and traffic violation capture. 
These cameras contain continuous ground-truth visual information on vehicles, pedestrians, and road infrastructure. 
My research leverages them for traffic flow monitoring, traffic emission estimation, and environmental justice analysisï¼š

By scraping camera footage from ~ 800 traffic cameras in New York, we reconstruct a citywide emission model to quantify pedestrian exposure to traffic emission considering environmental justice.
Via cutting-edge object detection, tracking, and segmentation methods, we extract real-time traffic flow, 
pedestrian volume, and > 3000 vehicle modes from camera footage, providing more accurate and detailed inputs for traffic emission models.

Most traffic cameras installed in the urban area only store low-FPS footage. 
We propose a unified framework capable of extracting traffic flow from videos of varying quality, 
covering super-low FPS, low FPS, and high FPS. 
Our approach integrates fundamental diagram, distance-based tracking, and ByteTrack, tailored to the respective FPS. 
We also develop an entirely automated traffic detector generator based on vanishing points and road segmentation.
