**Teaching:** I like teaching and consider it as an essential part of my academic life.
Effective teaching, in my view, relies on thorough pre-class preparation, open in-class environment, and active
post-class interaction. Moreover, it's equally crucial to recognize the diversity of student backgrounds and encourage
flexible engagement. I am well-prepared to teach both undergraduate and graduate courses in transportation, GIS, and
urban informatics. I’m also eager to develop new courses that combine my research with foundational transportation and GIS
theories.

**Student Mentoring:** Since graduate school, I have assisted my advisors in mentoring undergraduate, graduate, and high
school students.
We work together on different research projects, some of which have been published in top-tier journals. Now, as a
postdoc at MIT, I lead multiple teams each year through MIT’s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, where I
guide students from diverse fields like computer science, EECS, AI, CEE, and urban planning to collaborate on various
projects.
