During the COVID-19 pandemic, non-pharmaceutical interventions were widely employed to contain the dissemination of the virus by restricting people's travel and physical contact. 
I have closely worked together with [Prof. Chenfeng Xiong](https://www1.villanova.edu/university/engineering/academic-programs/departments/civil-environmental/directory/biodetail.html?mail=chenfeng.xiong@villanova.edu&xsl=bio_long) 
on building integrated econometric, epidemiological, and simulation models to examine (causal) relations among human mobility, public policies, vaccination, and virus transmission, which are critical to policy assessment, disease outbreak prediction, and public health management.
Related work has led to several high-caliber publications, including one [PNAS paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2010836117), over 5 top transportation papers, and an online [University of Maryland COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform](https://data.covid.umd.edu/).
