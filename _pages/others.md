Teaching, Mentoring, and Diversity
======
Through my teaching experiences, I've come to recognize that teaching has become an essential part of my academic life.
Effective teaching, in my view, relies on thorough pre-class preparation, open in-class environment, and active
post-class interaction. Moreover, it's equally crucial to recognize the diversity of student backgrounds and encourage
flexible engagement. I am well-prepared to teach both undergraduate and graduate courses in transportation, GIS, and
urban planning. I’m also eager to develop new courses that combine my research with foundational transportation and GIS
theories.

Since graduate school, I have assisted my advisors in mentoring undergraduate, graduate, and high school students,
working with them on research projects, some of which have been published in top-tier journals. Now, as a postdoc at
MIT, I lead multiple teams each year through MIT’s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), where I guide
students from diverse fields like computer science, EECS, AI, CEE, and urban planning to collaborate on various
projects.
