Teaching
======
Through my teaching experiences, I've come to recognize that teaching has become an essential part of my academic life.
Effective teaching, in my view, relies on thorough pre-class preparation, open in-class environment, and active
post-class interaction. I am well-prepared to instruct both undergraduate and graduate courses 
in general areas of transportation, GIS, and urban planning.
