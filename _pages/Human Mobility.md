Traditional travel demand models heavily rely on travel surveys, which are costly, laborious, and suffer from small-sample and infrequent issues. 
My Ph.D. dissertation focuses on building a big-data-driven digital twin model for estimating and forecasting human mobility at both collective and individual levels 
using location data from over 100 million monthly active mobile devices in the US. 
Specifically, My work is intended to leverage emerging big data, such as mobile device location data, digital social structure, traffic sensor records, and mobility transaction data, 
to extract population-representative trip itineraries, estimate multi-modal Origin-Destination matrices, and analyze individual travel behaviors.
