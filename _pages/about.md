Greetings! My name is Songhua Hu (胡松华), a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park. 
My supervisors include [Prof. Paul Schonfeld](https://cee.umd.edu/clark/faculty/291/Paul-Schonfeld) | [Prof. Lei Zhang](https://mti.umd.edu/national-transportation-center-contact-information) | [Prof. Chenfeng Xiong](https://cee.umd.edu/clark/faculty/855/Chenfeng-Xiong). 
I am now working as a graduate research assistant at the [Maryland Transportation Institute](https://mti.umd.edu/).
I am dedicated to smart city computing, both at the collective and individual levels, with particular emphasis on large-scale spatiotemporal network modelling. Specifically, my work intends to leverage crowdsourced mobile device location data, digital social structure, and mobility service transactions, in tandem with a host of statistical models, deep learning methods, and simulation techniques,
to forecast population-representative human mobility, analyze individual-level travel behaviors, understand shared mobility services and “Mobility as a service” (MaaS) infrastructure, and mesh them with advanced traffic simulation techniques.

Research Interests
======
### Big-data-driven human mobility modelling
My PhD career is committed to constructing an end-to-end big-data-driven travel demand modelling framework to estimate, predict, and simulate large-scale human movement, aggregately and disaggregately, leveraging massive location-based services (LBS) data and other transportation-related data, 
integrating a set of statistical methods, deep learning models, simulation tools, and cloud-computing technologies.
I introduce a temporal graph convolution neural network (TGCN) to predict PA/OD time-series matrices and a hierarchical semantic-based framework to simultaneously predict the activity, departure time, and location of the next trip. 
Predictions are integrated with advanced traffic simulation tools like DTALite and MATSim to achieve a holistic travel demand modelling process.

### Integrated modelling transport and epidemiology
During the COVID-19 pandemic, I focused my research on building integrated mathematical and epidemiological models to jointly examine relationships among human mobility, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and virus transmission, 
controlling for racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, demographic, occupation, and partisanship disparities.
Related work has lead to several high-caliber publications, including one [PNAS paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2010836117), over 5 top transportation papers, and an online [University of Maryland COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform](https://data.covid.umd.edu/).

### Mobility as a service (MaaS) and shared mobility
I have worked on shared mobility and MaaS since 2018, advised by [Prof. Hangfei Lin](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/szdw1/jsml2/jtgcx1/lhf.htm) | [Prof. Xiaohong Chen](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/szdw1/jsml2/jtgcx1/cxh.htm) | [Prof. Peng Chen](https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/public-affairs/about-us/faculty/pchen.aspx).
I have investigated various emerging shared mobility programs in China and US to provide empirical evidence on who is using shared mobility, 
how to promote efficiency and attractiveness of shared mobility, how to use personalized incentives to prevent users from churning, 
and how to encourage the integration of various forms of mobility services. I am also among the first to examine the nonlinear relationship between shared mobility usage and built environment via advanced statistical models and machine learning methods.
After joining University of Maryland, I am the main developer of first-in-the-nation coordinated MaaS mobile phone application, [incenTrip](https://incentrip.org), to assign personalized incentives to travelers in DC area.

### Integrated multimodal multidimensional traffic simulation
I am experienced in traditional traffic simulation tools including [Vissim](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/38350957), [TransCAD](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/61273834), [AnyLogic](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/66526593), and [DTALite](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/152268601), and Synchro.
I have leaded a range of traffic simulation projects in different Chinese cities such as Wuhan, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Suzhou, and Taiyuan, and US states like Maryland, DC, and Virginia.
I have also worked with [Prof. Xuesong Zhou](https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/2182101) on the development of the open-source multimodal traffic simulation framework, named DTALite, integrating agent-based modelling and dynamic traffic assignment.
