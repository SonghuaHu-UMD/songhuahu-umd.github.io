Greetings! My name is Songhua Hu (胡松华), a ABD Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park. 
My supervisor is [Prof. Paul Schonfeld](https://cee.umd.edu/clark/faculty/291/Paul-Schonfeld).
I am now working as a graduate research assistant at the [Maryland Transportation Institute](https://mti.umd.edu/).
As a transportation and mobility researcher, my research mainly focuses on ubiquitous computing (human mobility), spatiotemporal network modeling, infrastructure resilience, and health geography. 
I establish a set of advanced computing and modeling frameworks integrating AI-driven methods, statistical and econometric models, traffic simulation, and cloud computing techniques for ingesting multisource travel-related big data, constructing digit-twin mobility systems, forecasting future spatiotemporal mobility networks, and disentangling complex relationships among human travel behaviors and external factors.
