Greetings! My name is Songhua Hu (胡松华), a third-year Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park. 
My supervisors include [Prof. Paul Schonfeld](https://cee.umd.edu/clark/faculty/291/Paul-Schonfeld) | [Prof. Lei Zhang](https://mti.umd.edu/national-transportation-center-contact-information) | [Prof. Chenfeng Xiong](https://cee.umd.edu/clark/faculty/855/Chenfeng-Xiong). 
I am now working as a graduate research assistant at the [Maryland Transportation Institute](https://mti.umd.edu/).
I am dedicated to smart city computing, at both collective and individual levels, with particular emphasis on large-scale spatiotemporal network modelling. 
Specifically, my work is intended to leverage crowdsourced mobile device location data, digital social structure, and mobility service transactions, in tandem with a set of statistical models, deep learning methods, simulation tools, and cloud-computing techniques,
for forecasting population-representative human mobility, analyzing individual-level travel behaviors, understanding “Mobility as a service” (MaaS) infrastructure, and meshing them with advanced traffic simulation tools.

Research Interests
======
### Big-data-driven human mobility modelling
My PhD dissertation, entitled **"A BIG-DATA-DRIVEN FRAMEWORK FOR TRAVEL DEMAND ESTIMATION, PREDICTION, AND SIMULATION"**, is devoted to constructing an end-to-end big-data-driven travel demand modelling framework for estimating, predicting, and simulating large-scale human movement, aggregately and disaggregately, leveraging massive mobile device location data and other transportation-related data, 
integrating statistical methods, deep learning models, simulation tools, and cloud-computing techniques.

### Integrated modelling transport and epidemiology
During the COVID-19 pandemic, I focused my research on building integrated mathematical and epidemiological models to jointly examine relationships among human mobility, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and virus transmission,
controlling for racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, demographic, occupation, and partisanship disparities.
Related work has led to several high-caliber publications, including one [PNAS paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2010836117), over 5 top transportation papers, and an online [University of Maryland COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform](https://data.covid.umd.edu/).

### Explainable AI in transportation domain
I am particularly interested in empowering black-box machine(deep) learning models with interpretability by pre-designing interpretation-oriented parameters, or by applying post hoc model-agnostic interpretation techniques such as partial dependence plot, and SHapley Additive exPlanations.
I have incorporated these fantastic concepts into different transportation tasks such as travel demand estimation and crowd flow time series forecasting, to delineate the patterns learned by the model from massive travel data.

### Mobility as a service (MaaS) and shared mobility
I have worked on shared mobility since 2018, advised by [Prof. Hangfei Lin](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/szdw1/jsml2/jtgcx1/lhf.htm) | [Prof. Xiaohong Chen](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/szdw1/jsml2/jtgcx1/cxh.htm) | [Prof. Peng Chen](https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/public-affairs/about-us/faculty/pchen.aspx).
I have investigated various shared mobility programs to provide empirical evidence on who is using shared mobility, 
how to promote its efficiency, how to use incentives to prevent user churning, and how to encourage multimodal integration. 
After joining University of Maryland, I am the main developer of the first-in-the-nation coordinated MaaS mobile phone app, [incenTrip](https://incentrip.org), to assign personalized incentives to travelers in MD-DC-VA area.

### Integrated multidimensional traffic simulation
I am experienced in traditional traffic simulation tools including [Vissim](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/38350957), [TransCAD](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/61273834), [AnyLogic](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/66526593), [DTALite](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/152268601), and Synchro.
I have technically led a set of traffic simulation projects in China and US.
I have also worked with [Prof. Xuesong Zhou](https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/2182101) on the development of the open-source multimodal traffic simulation framework, named DTALite, integrating agent-based modelling and dynamic traffic assignment.
My current work focuses on meshing the big travel data with advanced traffic simulation tools with high computational efficiency to achieve fine-grained citywide simulation.
