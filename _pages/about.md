Greetings! My name is Songhua Hu (胡松华), a ABD Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park. 
My supervisor is [Prof. Paul Schonfeld](https://cee.umd.edu/clark/faculty/291/Paul-Schonfeld).
I am now working as a graduate research assistant at the [Maryland Transportation Institute](https://mti.umd.edu/).
As a transportation and mobility researcher, my research mainly focuses on ubiquitous computing (human mobility), spatiotemporal network modeling, infrastructure resilience, and health geography. 
I establish a set of advanced computing and modeling frameworks integrating AI-driven methods, statistical and econometric models, traffic simulation, and cloud computing techniques for ingesting multisource travel-related big data, constructing digit-twin mobility systems, forecasting future spatiotemporal mobility networks, and disentangling complex relationships among human travel behaviors and external factors.

Research Interests
======
## Big-data-driven human mobility estimation
Traditional travel demand models heavily rely on travel surveys, which are costly, laborious, and suffer from small-sample and infrequent issues. 
My Ph.D. dissertation focuses on building a big-data-driven digital twin model for estimating and forecasting human mobility at both collective and individual levels 
using location data from over 100 million monthly active mobile devices in the US. 
Specifically, My work is intended to leverage emerging big data, such as mobile device location data, digital social structure, traffic sensor records, and mobility transaction data, 
to extract population-representative trip itineraries, estimate multi-modal Origin-Destination matrices, and analyze individual travel behaviors.

## Large-scale spatiotemporal network forecasting
Spatiotemporal mobility forecasting is challenging due to complex spatiotemporal dependencies and heterogeneous external effects. 
My ongoing research focuses on large-scale spatiotemporal network forecasting using deep learning methods. 
I proposed a Multi-graph Multi-head Adaptive Temporal Graph Convolutional Network ([Multi-ATGCN](https://github.com/SonghuaHu-UMD/MultiSTGraph)), 
a general deep learning framework for citywide multi-step human mobility forecasting. 
Experiments on two real-world tasks demonstrate its steady performance improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. 
I also propose a hierarchical activity-based framework for simultaneously predicting the activity, time, and location of the next trip for each device.

## Sustainable, equitable, and resilient mobility infrastructure
Unexpected events lead to substantial impacts on mobility systems and irreversibly change human travel behaviors. 
My work focuses on qualitatively and quantitatively examining the time-varying resilience of transportation infrastructure under abnormal interventions, for example, modeling road traffic flow under inclement weather 
and comparing recovery patterns of multi-modal travel demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
My particular attention to accessibility inequities, policy barriers, and resilient disparities in underserved communities 
under unusual interventions provides valuable suggestions for a more sustainable, equitable, and resilient urban mobility system.

## Integrated modeling of travel behavior and public health
During the COVID-19 pandemic, non-pharmaceutical interventions were widely employed to contain the dissemination of the virus by restricting people's travel and physical contact. 
I have closely worked together with [Prof. Chenfeng Xiong](https://www1.villanova.edu/university/engineering/academic-programs/departments/civil-environmental/directory/biodetail.html?mail=chenfeng.xiong@villanova.edu&xsl=bio_long) 
on building integrated econometric, epidemiological, and simulation models to examine (causal) relations among human mobility, public policies, vaccination, and virus transmission, which are critical to policy assessment, disease outbreak prediction, and public health management.
Related work has led to several high-caliber publications, including one [PNAS paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2010836117), over 5 top transportation papers, and an online [University of Maryland COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform](https://data.covid.umd.edu/).

## Mobility as a service (MaaS) and shared mobility
I have extensive research experience in shared and smart mobility. 
In Tongji University, advised by [Prof. Hangfei Lin](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/szdw1/jsml2/jtgcx1/lhf.htm) | [Prof. Xiaohong Chen](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/szdw1/jsml2/jtgcx1/cxh.htm) | [Prof. Peng Chen](https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/public-affairs/about-us/faculty/pchen.aspx), 
I have investigated various shared mobility programs to provide empirical evidence on how to promote their efficiency, how to allocate incentives to prevent user turnover, and how to encourage multi-modal integration.
After joining University of Maryland, I am the technical leader of the first-in-the-nation MaaS APP "incenTrip" project, funded by USDOE and USDOT, to provide green travel options and personalized incentives for real-world travelers.

## Integrated multidimensional traffic simulation
I am experienced in traditional traffic simulation tools including [Vissim](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/38350957), [TransCAD](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/61273834), [AnyLogic](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/66526593), [DTALite](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/152268601), and Synchro.
I have technically led a set of traffic simulation projects in China and US.
I have also worked with [Prof. Xuesong Zhou](https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/2182101) on the development of the open-source multimodal traffic simulation framework, named DTALite, integrating agent-based modelling and dynamic traffic assignment.
My current work focuses on meshing the big travel data with advanced traffic simulation tools with high computational efficiency to achieve fine-grained citywide simulation.
