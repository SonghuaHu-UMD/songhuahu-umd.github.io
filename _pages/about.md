Greetings! My name is Songhua Hu (胡松华), a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park. 
My supervisor is [Prof. Lei Zhang](https://mti.umd.edu/national-transportation-center-contact-information) and [Prof. Chenfeng Xiong](https://cee.umd.edu/clark/faculty/855/Chenfeng-Xiong). Currently, I work as a graduate research assistant at the [Maryland Transportation Institute](https://mti.umd.edu/).
My research mainly focuses on leveraging emerging multisource transportation-related big data, such as mobile device location data, social media, mobility service transactions, transit smart-card data, and automatic road traffic sensors records, 
to quantify population-representative and near-real-time human mobility, analyze individual-level travel behaviors, understand shared mobility services and “Mobility as a service” (MaaS) infrastructure, and estimate multimodal, high-resolution travel demand.

Research Interests
======
### Big-data-driven human mobility modelling
My PhD career focuses on building a big-data-driven travel demand modelling framework to model, predict, and simulate large-scale human movement aggregately and disaggregately, leveraging massive location-based services (LBS) data, 
integrating a set of statistical methods, deep learning models, simulation tools, and cloud-computing technologies.
I introduce a spatiotemporal graph neural network (STGNN) to predict PA/OD time-series matrices and a temporal hierarchical transformer (THT) to predict individual-level trips. 
Predictions are integrated with transport simulation tools like DTALite and MATSim to achieve a complete travel demand modelling process.

### Integrated modelling transport and epidemiology
During the COVID-19 pandemic, I work on building integrated mathematical and statistical models to jointly examine relationships among human mobility, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and virus transmission, 
controlling for racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, demographic, occupation, and partisanship disparities.
Related work has lead to several high-caliber publications, including one [PNAS paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2010836117), over 5 top transportation papers, and an online [University of Maryland COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform](https://data.covid.umd.edu/).

### Mobility as a service (MaaS) and shared mobility
I have worked on shared mobility and MaaS since my master career with [Prof. Hangfei Lin](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/szdw1/jsml2/jtgcx1/lhf.htm) and [Prof. Xiaohong Chen](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/szdw1/jsml2/jtgcx1/cxh.htm) from Tongji University and [Prof. Peng Chen](https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/public-affairs/about-us/faculty/pchen.aspx) from USF.
I investigate various emerging shared mobility systems in China and US to provide empirical evidence on who is using shared mobility, 
how to promote efficiency and attractiveness of shared mobility, how to use personalized incentives to prevent users from churning, 
and how to encourage the integration of various forms of transport services. 
After joining UMD, I am the main developer of first-in-the-nation coordinated MaaS mobile phone application, [incenTrip](https://incentrip.org), to provide personalized incentives to travelers in DC area.

### Integrated multi-modal traffic simulation
I have six-years experiences in traffic simulation.
I am experienced in Vissim, Synchro, TransCAD, and AnyLogic.
I have leaded various micro and macro traffic simulation projects in different Chinese cities such as Wuhan, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Suzhou, and Taiyuan, and US states like Maryland, DC, and Virginia.
Currently, I am also working with [Prof. Xuesong Zhou](https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/2182101) from ASU on the development of multi-modal traffic simulation framework integrating agent-based modelling and dynamic traffic assignment.
