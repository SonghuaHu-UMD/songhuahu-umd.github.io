Greetings! My name is Songhua Hu (胡松华), a ABD Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering,
University of Maryland, College Park.
My supervisor is [Prof. Paul Schonfeld](https://cee.umd.edu/clark/faculty/291/Paul-Schonfeld).
I am now working as a graduate research assistant at the [Maryland Transportation Institute](https://mti.umd.edu/).
As a transportation and mobility researcher, my research mainly focuses on ubiquitous computing (human mobility),
spatiotemporal network modeling, infrastructure resilience, and health geography.
I establish a set of advanced computing and modeling frameworks integrating AI-driven methods, statistical and
econometric models, traffic simulation, and cloud computing techniques for ingesting multisource travel-related big
data, constructing digit-twin mobility systems, forecasting future spatiotemporal mobility networks, and disentangling
complex relationships among human travel behaviors and external factors.
