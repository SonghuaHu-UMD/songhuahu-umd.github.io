Greetings! I'm Songhua Hu (胡松华), a Postdoctoral Researcher at MIT specializing in urban mobility sensing and computing.
My research lies in leveraging big data and advanced computational methods to enhance urban transportation systems, 
minimize environmental impact of road traffic, and support equitable and efficient transportation planning.

Specifically, my research aims to: 

1)  Collect, organize, and fuse multi-structured mobility data crowdsouring from <span style="color: green"> _Mobile phones, City cameras, Connected vehicles, and Social media_</span>. 
2)  Replicate, simulate, and forecast large-scale human movement patterns over long periods under both recurrent and non-recurrent scenarios.  
3)  Examine the interaction between human mobility and urban environment, civil infrastructure, public health, and community equity. 

<span style="color: orange"> (_Deep learning, Statistics, Simulation, Network science, Cloud computing_)</span>,
My work has been applied to various scenarios such as <span style="color: blue"> _Digit-twin mobility system, Travel demand modelling, Transport geography, Mobility as a Service (MaaS), Travel behavioral economics, 
Disaster response, Transportation decarbonization, and Travel and Infectious Disease_</span>.
