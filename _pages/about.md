Greetings! I'm Songhua Hu (胡松华), a Postdoctoral Researcher at [MIT Senseable City Lab](https://senseable.mit.edu/). 
Before joining MIT, I earned my Ph.D. in Transportation Engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park. 
My research explores the nexus of human mobility, urban sensing, and data mining, 
with a particular emphasis on Human Mobility Sensing and Computing, Next-Generation Travel Demand Modelling, Mobility and Community Resilience, and Public Health Geography.

I'm passionate about seeking innovative solutions for complex urban transportation challenges using emerging crowdsensing and modelling techniques. 
I've been working with a diverse set of sensors (_Mobile phones, Mobile applications, Traffic cameras, Floating cars, Social media_) using different modelling approaches (_Deep learning, Statistics, Simulation, Network science, Cloud computing_). 
My work has been applied to various scenarios such as _Digit-twin mobility system, Mobility as a Service (MaaS), Travel behavioral economics, 
Disaster response and community resilience, Social sentiment and perception, Transportation decarbonization, Environmental justice, and Epidemiology_.
