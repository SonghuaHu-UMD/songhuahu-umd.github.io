Cheers! My name is Songhua Hu (胡松华), a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park. 
My supervisor is Dr. Lei Zhang. Currently, I work as a graduate research assistant at the [Maryland Transportation Institute](https://mti.umd.edu/).
I received my B.S. degree in Transportation Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2016 and a M.S. degree in Transportation Engineering from Tongji University in 2019. My research interests focus on Big data and cloud computing, Smart cities and shared mobility, Statistics modeling and deep learning, Dynamic spatiotemporal network, and Integrated multi-modal traffic simulation. 

***

Research Interests
======
### Integrated multi-modal traffic simulation
I have six-years experiences in traffic simulation. 
I am experienced in Vissim, Synchro, TransCAD, and AnyLogic. 
I have leaded various micro and macro traffic simulation projects in different cities such as Wuhan, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Suzhou, and Taiyuan. 
Currently, I am working on the development of an integrated multi-modal traffic simulation framework driven by agent-based deep learning and high-speed dynamic traffic assignment tools.

### Smart cities and shared mobility
I have one-year internship in EVCARD, the biggest carsharing program in China, as a data science to help support station placement and vehicle relocation. 
I have published several papers related to carsharing based on the data from EVCARD. 
I am now interested in the mixed shared mobility ecosystem across the U.S., and the emerging shared micromobility like e-scooters. 

### Dynamic spatiotemporal network
My Ph.D. career mainly focuses on the implement of network theory into human mobility. My current research efforts include three folds.
First, the visualization, quantification, and identification of dynamic human movement network.
Second, the combination of Long Short Term Memory networks and graph convolutional networks (LSTM-GCN).
Third, the implement of cloud-based distributed computing technology into large-scale spatiotemporal computation.
