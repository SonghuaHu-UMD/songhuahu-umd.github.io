Greetings! I'm Songhua Hu (胡松华), a Postdoctoral Researcher at MIT.
My research explores the nexus of **urban sensing**, **human mobility**, and **transportation system**. 
I'm passionate about seeking innovative solutions for complex urban transportation challenges using emerging crowdsensing and modelling techniques. 

I've been working with a diverse set of sensors <span style="color: green"> (_Mobile phones, Mobile apps, Traffic cameras, Floating cars, Social media_)</span> using different modelling approaches <span style="color: orange"> (_Deep learning, Statistics, Simulation, Network science, Cloud computing_)</span>. 
My work has been applied to various scenarios such as <span style="color: blue"> _Digit-twin mobility system, Travel demand modelling, Transport geography, Mobility as a Service (MaaS), Travel behavioral economics, 
Disaster response, Transportation decarbonization, and Travel and Infectious Disease_</span>.
