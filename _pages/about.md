Greetings! My name is Songhua Hu (胡松华), and I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [MIT Senseable City Lab](https://senseable.mit.edu/). 
My research interests revolve around the intersection of transportation and data science, 
with a focus on Urban Computing (Human Mobility), Spatiotemporal Network Modeling, Transportation Economics, Computational Social Science, and Health Geography.
I enjoy exploring novel solutions to complex transportation problems and am always eager to experiment with emerging coding and modelling techniques.
My research is grounded in a diverse set of AI-driven models, statistical models, econometric theories, traffic simulation, and cloud computing techniques.
