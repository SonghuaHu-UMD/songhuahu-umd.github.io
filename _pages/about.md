Greetings! I'm Songhua Hu (ËÉ°ÊùæÂçé), a Postdoctoral Researcher at MIT specializing in urban mobility sensing and
computing.
My work leverages big data and new computational methods to advance smart, sustainable, resilient, and equitable
mobility systems.

My research specifically involves: 1) Collecting and fusing multi-structured mobility data collected from
<span style="color: Yellowgreen"> Mobile Phones, City Cameras, Connected Vehicles, and Social Media</span>. 2)
Simulating and forecasting large-scale human movement under <span style="color: Yellowgreen"> both Recurrent and
Non-Recurrent
scenarios</span>. 3) Modeling the interaction between <span style="color: Yellowgreen">Human Mobility</span> and
<span style="color: Yellowgreen"> Urban Environment, Transport Network, Public Health, and Social Equity</span>.

My theoretical foundation surrounds <span style="color: Darkorange">Deep learning, Statistics, Traffic Simulation,
Network Science</span>.
Applications of my work span areas such as:
<span style="color: royalblue">Sustainable Mobility</span> (Vehicle Emission Estimation, Vehicle Electrification,
Mobility as a Service (MaaS)),
<span style="color: royalblue">Emergency Response</span>(Network Resilience, Community Vulnerability),
<span style="color: royalblue">Transport and Health</span>(Computational Epidemiology, Human Exposure, Health
Disparity),
<span style="color: royalblue">Transportation Planning, Management, and Operation</span>(Travel Demand Modelling,
Transportation Economics, Travel Behavioral Analysis, Accessibility).
