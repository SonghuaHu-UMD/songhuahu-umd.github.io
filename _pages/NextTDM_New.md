Traditional travel demand models heavily rely on travel surveys, which are costly, laborious, and suffer from
small-sample and infrequent issues.
My Ph.D. dissertation focuses on building a next-generation travel demand model which is fully big-data-driven.
This includes 1) a normative pipeline for parsing multi-source travel data to derive trip rosters and 
multi-modal OD matrices, 2) a set of spatiotemporal neural networks for forecasting future travel demand, and 3) 
a set of traffic simulation tools for simulating traffic flow at both individual and aggregated level.

Fully relying on mobile device data and using survey as validation, I build a pipeline to extract individual trip rosters, including 
home&work identification, trip identification, mode imputation, population weighting, and result validation. 
These trip rosters are then aggregated at different spatiotemporal units to construct multi-modal OD matrices.

Using the nationwide census block group-level trip flow derived from mobile device locations as the proxy of travel demand, 
we examine its relations with various factors including socioeconomics, demographics, and land use. 
A host of tree-based machine learning models and interpretation techniques are extensively compared to determine the 
best model architecture and justify interpretation robustness. Pronounced nonlinearities, threshold effects, and interaction effects 
are observed in relations among travel demand and most of its determinants.

Spatiotemporal mobility forecasting is challenging due to complex spatiotemporal dependencies and heterogeneous external
effects. I proposed a Multi-graph Multi-head Adaptive Temporal Graph Convolutional Network ([Multi-ATGCN](https://github.com/SonghuaHu-UMD/MultiSTGraph)),
a general deep learning framework for citywide multi-step human mobility forecasting.
Experiments on two real-world tasks demonstrate its steady performance improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Compared with aggregated forecasting, individual-level trip itinerary forecasting is more challenging 
because of highly-random spatiotemporal patterns of individual travels, multi-structure forecasting tasks, and imbalanced distributions of places and activities.
I propose a hierarchical activity-based framework for simultaneously predicting the activity, time, and location of
the next trip for each device. Meanwhile, loss functions in the semantic segmentation domain are introduced to address the imbalanced classification issue.

The surge in food delivery services is reshaping lifestyles and urban form.
Through an analysis of customer reviews of food delivery services extracted from nationwide Google Reviews, 
we examine how people's attitudes to food delivery change over time and identify the key related factors. 
By fusing with mobile phone location data, we further infer whether the growth of delivery services would decrease in-person visit to restaurants.
