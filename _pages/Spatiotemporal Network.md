Spatiotemporal mobility forecasting is challenging due to complex spatiotemporal dependencies and heterogeneous external effects. 
My ongoing research focuses on large-scale spatiotemporal network forecasting using deep learning methods. 
I proposed a Multi-graph Multi-head Adaptive Temporal Graph Convolutional Network ([Multi-ATGCN](https://github.com/SonghuaHu-UMD/MultiSTGraph)), 
a general deep learning framework for citywide multi-step human mobility forecasting. 
Experiments on two real-world tasks demonstrate its steady performance improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. 
I also propose a hierarchical activity-based framework for simultaneously predicting the activity, time, and location of the next trip for each device.
