Unexpected events lead to substantial impacts on mobility systems and irreversibly change human travel behaviors. 
My work focuses on qualitatively and quantitatively examining the time-varying resilience of transportation infrastructure under abnormal interventions, for example, modeling road traffic flow under inclement weather 
and comparing recovery patterns of multi-modal travel demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
My particular attention to accessibility inequities, policy barriers, and resilient disparities in underserved communities 
under unusual interventions provides valuable suggestions for a more sustainable, equitable, and resilient urban mobility system.
