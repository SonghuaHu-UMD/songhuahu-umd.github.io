I am experienced in traditional traffic simulation tools including [Vissim](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/38350957)
, [TransCAD](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/61273834), [AnyLogic](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/66526593)
, [DTALite](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/152268601), and Synchro.
I have technically led a set of traffic simulation projects in China and US.
I have also worked with [Prof. Xuesong Zhou](https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/2182101) on the development of the
open-source multimodal traffic simulation framework, named DTALite, integrating agent-based modelling and dynamic
traffic assignment.
My current work focuses on meshing the big travel data with advanced traffic simulation tools with high computational
efficiency to achieve fine-grained citywide simulation.
