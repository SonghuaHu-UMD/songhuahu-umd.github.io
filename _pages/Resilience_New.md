Unexpected events, such as natural disasters, diseases, and extreme weather events, lead to substantial impacts on human travel.
My work focuses on quantitatively examining the time-varying patterns of human travel before, during, and after theses abnormal interventions.
My particular attention to accessibility inequities, policy barriers, and resilient disparities in underserved
communities under unusual interventions provides valuable suggestions for a more sustainable, equitable, and resilient urban
mobility system.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a globally unprecedented decline in transit ridership. We leverage the 20-years daily transit ridership data in Chicago to infer the impact of COVID-19 on ridership using the Bayesian structural time series model, 
controlling confounding effects of trend, seasonality, holiday, and weather. 
Results show that ridership declined more in regions with more commercial lands and higher percentages of white, educated, and high-income individuals.

Leveraging two-year bike-sharing trips from the largest bike-sharing program in Chicago, we examine the spatiotemporal evolution of bike-sharing usage across the pandemic and compares it with other modes of transport.
We find that bike-sharing presents as a more resilient option compared with transit, driving, and walking. 
Also, stations near the city center or located in high-income areas go from more increase before the pandemic to more decrease during the pandemic.

### <span style="color: green"> Link-level Road Traffic Resilience to Extreme Weather</span> ❄️❄️❄️🚧🚧🚧

Heavy rain can induce road flooding especially in the urban areas due to their poor drainage systems, 
which will exacerbate its effect on transportation systems. Effectively identifying
the flooding road segment can help people plan their travel reasonably and reduce losses. Combing the precipitation and traffic flow data from floating cars, 
we develop an automaic road flooding detection algorithm and deployed it to Shenzhen City. Result shows the algorithm performs
satisfactorily with a 68%–90% detection rate and a 1.5%–2% false alarm rate.

Climate changes lead to more frequent and intense weather events, posing escalating risks to road traffic. 
Crowdsourced data offer new opportunities to monitor and investigate changes in road traffic flow during extreme weather. 
We utilize diverse crowdsourced data from mobile devices and the community-driven navigation app, Waze, to examine the impact of three weather events – floods, winter storms, and fog – on road traffic.
We find winter storms have the greatest impact on road traffic, followed by flooding and fog. At a link level, lower-class roads with lower average speeds and volumes experience milder changes.
